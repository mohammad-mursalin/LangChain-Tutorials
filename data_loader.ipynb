       "'GPT-5 is a multimodal large language model developed by OpenAI and the fifth in its series of generative pre-trained transformer (GPT) foundation models. Preceded in the series by GPT-4, it was launched on August 7, 2025, combining reasoning capabilities and non-reasoning functionality under a common interface. At its time of release, GPT-5 had state-of-the-art performance on various benchmarks. The model is publicly accessible to users of the chatbot products ChatGPT and Microsoft Copilot as well as to developers through the OpenAI API.\\n\\n\\n== Background ==\\n\\nOn April 14, 2023, Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, spoke at an event at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology and said that the company was not training GPT-5 at that time. He stated that OpenAI was \"prioritizing GPT-4 development\" and that \"we are not and won\\'t for some time\" release GPT-5.\\nOn July 18, OpenAI filed for a \"GPT-5\" trademark in the United States. On November 13, Altman confirmed to the Financial Times that the company was working to develop GPT-5.\\nAccording to The Information, \"[f]or much of the second half of 2024, OpenAI was developing a model known internally as Orion and intended to become GPT-5\", \"[b]ut the Orion effort failed to produce a better model, and the company instead released it as GPT-4.5 in February [2025].\"\\nBy late July 2025, OpenAI was widely anticipated as planning to release GPT-5 in early August. On July 30, The Verge reported that \"Microsoft is getting ready for GPT-5\" as \"sources familiar with Microsoft\\'s AI plans\" told an editor that the company was testing a new mode for its Copilot chatbot that would offer a model that \"thinks deeply or quickly based on the task\". On August 5, in the leadup to the release of GPT-5, OpenAI released GPT-OSS, a set of two open-weight models that have reasoning capabilities. GPT-5 was then unveiled during a livestream event on August 7.\\n\\n\\n== Capabilities ==\\nAt the time of its release, GPT-5 had state-of-the-art performance on benchmarks that test mathematics, programming, finance, and multimodal understanding. According to OpenAI, improvements over its predecessor models include faster response times, better coding and writing skills, more accurate answers to health questions, and lower levels of hallucination. Also, compared to previous models, GPT-5 aims to give safe, high-level responses to potentially harmful queries rather than outright declining them, an approach that OpenAI refers to as \"safe completions\", aiming to result \"in GPT-5 being able to refuse more unsafe questions, while offering fewer rejections to users seeking harmless information.\" In addition, GPT-5 was trained to give more critical, \"less effusively agreeable\" answers compared to its predecessor models.\\nDays before the launch of GPT-5, two early testers of the model stated that they were \"impressed\" by its ability to code and to solve mathematical and scientific problems. They suggested that the model shows great improvement from GPT-4, but not as large of a gain as from GPT-3 to GPT-4. A day prior to the release of GPT-5, during a press briefing, Sam Altman, the chief executive officer of OpenAI, called GPT-5 \"a significant step along the path to AGI\", referring to artificial general intelligence, the hypothetical level of intelligence that OpenAI defines as the ability to perform any economically valuable task that a human can. According to Altman, GPT-5 is \"significantly better\" than its predecessors, offering \"PhD-level\" abilities across a wide range of tasks.\\nThe exact energy consumption of GPT-5 use has not been disclosed by OpenAI. Researchers at the University of Rhode Island estimated that a medium-length response consumes slightly over 18 watt-hours, equivalent to using an incandescent bulb for 18 minutes.\\n\\n\\n=== Architecture ===\\n\\nGPT-5 is a system that contains a fast, high-throughput model, a deeper reasoning model, and a real-time router that decides which model to use based on conversation type'"
