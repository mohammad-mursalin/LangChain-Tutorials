However, what's lesser-known is that Ronaldo has a rare genetic condition known as 'port wine stain.' This birthmark is typically found on the face and can sometimes be a sign of Sturge-Weber syndrome, a rare disorder that affects the skin, brain, and eyes.\\n\\nRonaldo's birthmark covers a significant portion of his face and head, which was noticeable as a young boy. The condition didn't seem to affect his sports career, and he has become a global celebrity.\\n\\nThis is just one of the many fascinating facts about Cristiano Ronaldo that goes beyond his impressive football career.\""
